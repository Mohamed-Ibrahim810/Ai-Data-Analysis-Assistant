3. **Handle missing values early**

   - Address missing values before performing other transformations

4. **Use appropriate transformations**

   - For skewed numeric data, consider log transformations
   - For categorical data with many categories, consider grouping or one-hot encoding

5. **Save intermediate results**

   - Download your data after important transformations as a backup

6. **Ask specific questions**
   - When using the AI analysis, be specific in your questions for better results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**File upload errors:**

- Ensure your file is in CSV or Excel format
- Check that the file size is under 100MB
- Try saving your Excel file as CSV if problems persist

**Missing values in results:**

- Check if your data contains NaN or null values
- Use the "Handle Missing Values" transformation to address them

**Data type errors:**

- If a transformation fails due to data type issues, use the "Change Data Type" option first
- Ensure numeric operations are only applied to numeric columns

**API key issues:**

- Verify that your Google API key is correctly set up
- Check that the key has access to the Gemini API

**Performance issues with large datasets:**

- Consider filtering or sampling your data to reduce size
- Focus on relevant columns by removing unnecessary ones
